Description:   Filters sequences according to their taxonomy,
as determined by the sequence name.  Sequences should
be labeled with a gi number, NCBI taxID, or species name.

Usage:  filterbytaxa.sh in=<input file> out=<output file> tree=<tree file> table=<table file> ids=<numbers> level=<name or number>

Input may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.


Standard parameters:
in=<file>       Primary input, or read 1 input.
out=<file>      Primary output, or read 1 output.
overwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than
                overwrite an existing file.
showspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display of processing speed.
ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression
                level; lower compression is faster.

Processing parameters:
level=          Taxonomic level, such as phylum.  Filtering will operate on
                sequences within the same taxonomic level as specified ids.
reqlevel=       Require nodes to have ancestors at these levels.  For example,
                reqlevel=species,genus would ban nodes that are not defined
                at both the species and genus levels.
ids=            Comma-delimited list of NCBI numeric IDs.
names=          Alternately, a list of names (such as 'Homo sapiens').
                Note that spaces need special handling.
include=f       'f' will discard filtered sequences, 't' will keep them.
tree=           A taxonomic tree made by TaxTree, such as tree.taxtree.gz.
table=          A table translating gi numbers to NCBI taxIDs.
                Only needed if gi numbers will be used.

String-matching parameters:
regex=          Filter names matching this Java regular expression.
contains=       Filter names containing this substring (case-insensitive).


* Note *
Tree and table files are in /global/projectb/sandbox/gaag/bbtools/tax
For non-Genepool users, or to make new ones, use taxtree.sh and gitable.sh

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will be passed to Java to set memory usage, overriding the program's automatic memory detection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.  The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
